                        <h1>Wealth Creation</h1>
                        <p>According to my colleague Corey Mann’s excellent definition, wealth creation is the steady and consistent accumulation of income and assets over a period of time.
                            Many people confuse getting rich with being wealthy. But those two are not at all the same thing. Getting rich is often fleeting. Building wealth in a sustainable way is the foundation for financial health and freedom for life – for you, and even for your heirs.
                            Of course, having a large income can be one important step on the road to wealth creation. But in some cases, even a modest income can be leveraged into wealth.                           
                            Plus, there are many steps to building wealth. In fact, your income is not the most important factor at all when compared with your spending and expenses, your debt, and your investments.
                            Let’s look at each of these four factors now: income, expenses, debt and investing. Then we will have a better idea of what wealth creation really is and how to go about. Call for a price estimate.
